# About

Repo containing code sketches for arduino.

## Notes

- For `11-light_detector`, an additionnal processing sketch can be found at `./processing/light_detector/light_detector.pde`
- You should have a `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` and `.vscode/arduino.json` file in your project folder to have the correct intellisense and build settings. You can find examples in the `./vscode` folder.
- I added a `./libraries` folder to store my custom libraries. You can copy them to your arduino libraries folder or add them to your project folder, or include its path in the `c_cpp_properties.json` file at the `includePath` key.
